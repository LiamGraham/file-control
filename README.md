A git-powered automatic version control tool for everday use.

(Currently in development)

## Summary

Verdite provides the advantages of a sophisticated version control system like git without you having to learn any commands or open a terminal. It automatically detects and stores changes made to files in the selected
directory (not unlike products like Google Drive and Dropbox). You can then view prior
versions of files and restore them via the user interface.
