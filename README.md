A git-powered automatic version control tool for everday use.

(Currently in development)

## Summary

Verdite automatically detects and stores changes made to files stored in a dedicated
directory (not unlike products like Google Drive and Dropbox). Users may view prior
versions of files and restore them, if desired.
