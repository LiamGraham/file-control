    - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30983500/how-to-save-changes-when-in-detached-head-state
- Revert to previous versions
    - This 'reversion' may consist of:
        - Revert to previous file version and delete 'upstream'/later versions
- New files are automatically staged and committed
- Changes to files are automatically committed upon the change occurring

Structure:
- Main program loop - control.py (monitors state of files and makes necessary commits)
- Repo management interface - manage.py
- Version viewing/restoring GUI - gui.py

Tools:
- sh (git interface)
- PyInstaller (application bundler) (https://pyinstaller.readthedocs.io/en/v3.3.1/)
- PyQt (GUI)

Plan:
1. Implement repo management interface
2. Implement main program loop
3. Implement user interface
4. Assemble components into application
5. Bundle files for distribution
